# Advanced TypeScript Patterns

TypeScript offers powerful type system features that can help you write safer, more maintainable code.

## Utility Types

TypeScript provides several built-in utility types that can help transform types:

- `Partial<T>`: Makes all properties optional
- `Required<T>`: Makes all properties required
- `Pick<T, K>`: Creates a type with only specified properties
- `Omit<T, K>`: Creates a type without specified properties

## Generic Constraints

Use generic constraints to create more flexible yet type-safe functions.

## Mapped Types

Mapped types allow you to create new types based on existing ones.

## Conclusion

Mastering these patterns will significantly improve your TypeScript code quality.
