# Welcome to My First MDX Blog Post!

This is an example of a blog post written in MDX. You can use regular Markdown syntax here.

## Markdown Features

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Code blocks:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, MDX!");
```

## React Components in MDX

One of the coolest things about MDX is that you can embed React components directly!

Here's a button component from our UI library:

<Button onClick={() => alert("You clicked me!")}>Click Me!</Button>

Isn't that neat?

## Conclusion

Writing content with MDX is powerful and flexible. Enjoy creating your posts!
