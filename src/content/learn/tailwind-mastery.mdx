# Mastering Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that speeds up development.

## Core Concepts

### Utility Classes
Use single-purpose classes to build designs directly in HTML.

### Responsive Design
Use responsive prefixes: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`

### Custom Configuration
Extend Tailwind through `tailwind.config.js`:
- Custom colors
- Custom spacing
- Custom fonts

## Advanced Techniques

- Creating reusable components
- Using @apply for complex utilities
- JIT mode for better performance

## Best Practices

- Keep HTML readable
- Use component extraction for repeated patterns
- Leverage design tokens
